# Finished BlogPost website
## My thoughts after going through all the basics and tutorials
This framework really is good for content delivery-based sites, as its claim suggests. They are fast and flexible, and in terms of performance, there is no reason to argue that this framework is top-tier in this field, and with its architecture, in which you can write UI components separately as modules and plug-ins to play wherever you want as you please, this is a massive advantage over other frameworks I have tried. Not only that, their own language, 'Astro', is easy to learn, but it seamlessly works with other frameworks as well. I think from all of the above reasons, I would surely consider building my next project, such as a portfolio website, blog post, and simple ML/AI demo application, which would work perfectly.

I am really excited to create projects with this framework.
