# Finished BlogPost website
## My thoughts after going through all the basics and tutorials
As its claim suggests, this framework is indeed useful to content delivery-based websites. They are fast and flexible, and there's no denying that this framework performs at the highest level in this domain. What sets it apart from other frameworks I've tried is its architecture, which allows you to write UI components independently as modules and plug-ins to play wherever you please. Furthermore, their own language, "Astro," not only functions flawlessly with other frameworks but is also simple to learn. For the reasons listed above, I believe I would definitely think about creating my next project, which would be an ideal blog post, portfolio website, and straightforward ML/AI demo application.

I am really excited to create projects with this framework.
